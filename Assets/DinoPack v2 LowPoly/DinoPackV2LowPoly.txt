Prefab Models:
All models are already ready for use in practical prefab already generated and ready for you you just place them in the scene.


optimizations:

1-Models Lowpoly saving on quantities of polygons
2-Skeleton:
Using a few bones but that guarantee a realistic movement necessary in order to ease the calculation.
3-Animations
Using short animations, big impact, Savings Calculation.
4-TextureAtlas:
Including homestyle considerable savings calculation.


Ps important:
it is possible that many models generally understood you present a notice in the console:
ImportFBX Warnings:
Can not import tangents and binormals, Because mesh.
It frequently happens that Unity3D present this message because of particular exports and good to note that this does not mean that the model and compromise.
proceed in this way:
the item Model / Normals and Tangents.
Normals:
Calculate

Smooting angle = 180

Tangents
